<h1> The Best Series According to Sanam</h1>
<h2> My top 3 Series of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3> The Office</h3>
<p> This is the sitcom and I love watching as it as humor in and makes me happy and joyful.</p>

<h3> Vampire Diaries</h3>
<p> Its vampire drama series and love learning about vampires, witches and wolfs. It is a supernatural horror young adult novel.</p>

<h3> Manifest </h3>
<p> I really like watching the drama series. This does reference  real life events, artificats and people but the show is not based on true story and is purely fiction. This series has the power to keep audience focused, intrested and connected. </p>
